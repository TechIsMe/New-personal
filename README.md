Personal Portfolio

## Introduction
I Created a responsive React portfolio website using HTML,CSS ,functional components and React hooks. 

## Description
I built a personal portfolio website in React JS.by using a couple react packages such as "React Icons" and "React Router Dom V6" so I can have multiple pages in my React application. The homepage features a full width video hero component . Also, I passed dynamic data via props to a hero image class component that allowed me to reuse a component while adding different data to each page.
