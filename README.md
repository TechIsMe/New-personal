## Introduction

I Created a responsive React portfolio website to showcase some of the projects I have been working on for the last 6 month. 

## Description
I built this  personal portfolio website in React JS by using a couple react packages such as "React Icons" and "React Router Dom V6" so I can have multiple pages in my React application. The homepage features a full width video hero component . Also, I passed dynamic data via props to a hero image class component that allowed me to reuse a component while adding different data to each page.
